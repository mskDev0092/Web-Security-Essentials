## Web Security Essentials

> Web security essentials refer to the fundamental principles and practices that should be followed in order to ensure the security of web applications. This includes such things as proper authentication and authorization, input validation, output encoding, session management, error handling, and more. Following these security essentials can help to protect web applications from common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks. Additionally, following these security essentials can help to ensure that data is encrypted and secure, and that the integrity of the data is maintained.

# 1. HTTPS matters

> HTTPS helps to ensure that communications between a website and a user's browser are secure and not tampered with by unauthorized third parties. It helps to protect users from malicious attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify data being sent between the two parties. HTTPS also helps to ensure that the website is the legitimate one and not an imposter site. Furthermore, HTTPS helps to ensure that data is encrypted, making it difficult for attackers to access and read the data. Finally, HTTPS also helps to ensure the integrity of the data being sent, as the data is verified to be unaltered when it reaches its destination.

# 2. OWASP Web Application Security Testing Checklist

> The OWASP Web Application Security Testing Checklist is a comprehensive list of tests that should be performed when testing the security of a web application. The checklist covers areas such as authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding, session management, error handling, and more. This list can be used to ensure that all areas of a web application are tested and that no security weaknesses are overlooked. Additionally, the checklist can help to guide security testers in their security testing efforts, ensuring that all relevant areas are tested and that no tests are missed.

# 3. OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities

> The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the ten most common and critical web application security risks. It is designed to help developers identify and address security vulnerabilities in their applications. The list is updated regularly and currently includes the following risks:
| Table of Contents  |
| --- |
|   Injection |
|    Broken Authentication |
|   Sensitive Data Exposure |
|  XML External Entities (XXE) |
| Broken Access Control |
|   Security Misconfiguration |
|  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |
|    Insecure Deserialization |
|   Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities |
|  Insufficient Logging and Monitoring |

# 4. OWASP Cheat Sheet

> The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series is a collection of documents which aim to provide a concise collection of security best practices for web applications. The documents provide a guideline to help developers avoid common security issues when creating web applications. The cheat sheets cover topics such as authentication, input validation, session management, error handling, and more. Additionally, the cheat sheets provide links to more in-depth resources and tutorials to help developers better understand the subject matter.

# 5. Content Security Policy (CSP)

> Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security mechanism that helps to protect web applications from cross-site scripting (XSS), data injection attacks, and other malicious activities. It works by instructing web browsers on what type of content is allowed to be loaded and executed on a page, and helps to prevent malicious code from being executed. CSP can be enforced by adding a header to an HTTP response, or by adding a meta tag to an HTML page. CSP can also be used to restrict the use of certain APIs such as eval(), making it more difficult for attackers to execute malicious code.
