# 1. HTTPS matters

> HTTPS helps to ensure that communications between a website and a user's browser are secure and not tampered with by unauthorized third parties. It helps to protect users from malicious attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify data being sent between the two parties. HTTPS also helps to ensure that the website is the legitimate one and not an imposter site. Furthermore, HTTPS helps to ensure that data is encrypted, making it difficult for attackers to access and read the data. Finally, HTTPS also helps to ensure the integrity of the data being sent, as the data is verified to be unaltered when it reaches its destination.
